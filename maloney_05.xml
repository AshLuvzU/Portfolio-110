    <para num="1">I received particular joy at seeing, within the smell of the land, an Old
        Yorkshire man of foreseer who had left his son a merchant in New York, to breath his last in
        his native land; far from the continued storms we met &amp; feeble situation he was in from
        sea sickness I had been apprehensive we should have lost him on the passage.</para>
    <para num="2"> Coasting the Southwest shore of Ireland on that 18th in the evening we made Cork,
        where we were (sp. where) becalmed – we met there a ship we had seen two days before at a
        distance, she was an armed vessel of Liverpool, that had been at Barbados, and was now
        returning, she had on board the Governor, and suite of a Dutch settlement in the West
        Indies, lately taken by the British troops – There is not much appearance of verdure yet on
        shore – or it might in some respect afford a beautiful prospect – <edit color="dark brown"
            correction="yes">but they have a disagreeable way of decorating their coasts with
            gibbets (sp. jibbets) here and there</edit>
        <!--scribbled out text under the aformentioned edit--> – Is it not surprising, that a people
        so enlightened, so humane and so polite should have it so arranged, that the first object
        striking the view of the strangers, who approach their <edit color="dark brown"
            correction="yes">shore</edit> should be an emblem of the severity of their laws and
        depravity of some of their people. Telegraphs were also to be seen on every eminence – this
        is a late invention to communicate intelligence of the approach of an enemy or to give
        orders to the ships of the Navy – they are on a line of <offPage cutOff="yes"
            >communica-tion</offPage> within distinct view of each other – certain figures are put
        up which are repeated from one (p.35) to the other without being understood by any but those
        from <color type="dark brown">whom</color> the orders issue and the commanders of Posts. We
        there learnt, by the boats which came from the shore, that all was as yet tranquil, that
        they had only heard of the threats of Bonaparte which it was not likely, he would be able to
        put in <offPage cutOff="yes">execu-tion</offPage>.</para>
    <para num="3"> After night a fair wind springing up, we made sail, and next morning, <edit
            color="dark brown" added="yes">we</edit> were abreast of Wicklow <offPage cutOff="yes"
            >Moun-tains</offPage>, the land is high and elevated, but we were at too great a
        distance to distinctly view it – On the 21st we sailed along the Welsh Coast and passed
        Holyhead – here is elevated land &amp; lofty mountains, whose tops are covered with snow,
        which although they do not prepossess you with an idea of the fertility of the country, yet
        the <edit added="yes">natural</edit> Majestic grandeur of the
        <!--scribbled out word between 'the' and 'asylum'--> asylum of the descendants of ancient
        Britons strikes the mind with veneration at the magnanimity and unfortunate valor of their
        ancestors who preferred breathing the air of freedom on Rocky Mountains, to remaining in
        subjection on their native fertile plains, and calls a sigh for their hero the gallant
        Caractacus.</para>
    <para num="4"> In the evening a Pilot comes on board and next day we arrive safe in dock here,
        the pleasure we felt on the occasion can not well be imagined by any but those, who have
        made a long sea voyage. Altho’ this was Sunday and business lulled at rest, yet sufficient
        was to be seen to give a stranger some conception of the magnitude of the trade carried on
        at this place – the many store houses, the multitude of ships, the inland canals and docks
        all denote wealth &amp; exertion, these last are of two kind wet and dry, the latter are to
        receive vessels to be repaired; the former are for (p.36) ships to unload and load in; they
        are made by digging spaces to <edit added="yes">such</edit> a level
        <!--scribbled out word between 'level' and 'as'--> as to be of sufficient depth for the
        vessels that are to enter the gates of these docks at which the vessels, and flow of the
        tide are received, are shut in the ebb tide by which means the water is retained that keeps
        the ships afloat – were it not for these constructions the lading and unlading would be
        performed with great inconvenience at this port which is not naturally well calculated, the
        River being amazing shallow at low water, and its entry rendered difficult from a number of
        sand banks.</para>
    <para num="5"> But the approximate situation of this place to <edit added="yes">several</edit>
        <!--scribbled out text between 'to' and 'manufacturing'--> manufacturing town
        <!--scribbled out word between 'town' and 'renders'-->renders it the great emporium of
        commerce to the West – It is here that are deposited the stuffs of Manchester, the cutlery
        of Birmingham and the woolen cloths of Yorkshire, as are also the produce of the west for
        which they are bartered – it is considered next to London for importance in trade: that of
        Africa however is a branch <!--scribbled out word between 'branch' and 'that'--> that is
        carried on here to some extent <!--scribbled out word between 'extent' and 'and'--> and is

        must not by this imagine, that the slaves are brought here, no, for none would be slaves
        after they had breathed the British air – they are bought in Africa for coarse clothes, arms
        spirits &amp; taken to the West Indies and sold for the produce of these Islands, which is
        brought to this place &amp; from it taken to different parts of the country.</para>
